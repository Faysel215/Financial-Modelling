### **Project: Implementing an LSTM and Graph Convolutional Network Model for Stock Trend Prediction**

### **I. Project Overview & Goal**

The primary objective of this project is to create a Python implementation of the hybrid model proposed by Ran et al. (2024). The model leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal features from individual stock data and a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to model the interdependencies between stocks for more accurate trend prediction.

### **II. Implementation Outline**

#### **Part 1: Environment Setup & Dependencies**

This section covers the necessary libraries for the project.

- **Core Libraries:**
    
    - `numpy`: For numerical operations and matrix manipulations.
        
    - `pandas`: For data manipulation and reading stock data.
        
- **Deep Learning & Machine Learning:**
    
    - `tensorflow` or `torch`: For building and training the LSTM and GCN models.
        
    - `scikit-learn`: For data preprocessing (e.g., scaling) and evaluation metrics.
        
- **Graph-Specific Libraries:**
    
    - `dgl` (Deep Graph Library) or `PyG` (PyTorch Geometric): To simplify the implementation of the GCN.
        
- **Data Retrieval (Optional):**
    
    - `yfinance` or other financial data APIs: To fetch historical stock data.
        
- **Visualization (Optional):**
    
    - `matplotlib` or `seaborn`: For plotting results and visualizations.
        

#### **Part 2: Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**

This stage involves gathering and preparing the data for the model. The paper uses China A50 stocks as a basis.

1. **Data Acquisition:**
    
    - Select a universe of stocks (e.g., S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, or a specific sector).
        
    - Download historical daily stock data for each selected stock. Features should include:
        
        - Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) prices
            
        - Volume
            
        - Optionally, include technical indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, etc.
            
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    
    - **Handle Missing Data:** Check for and handle any missing values (e.g., forward-fill or interpolation).
        
    - **Feature Scaling:** Normalize the features (e.g., using `MinMaxScaler` from scikit-learn) to a range like [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. This is crucial for the performance of neural networks.
        
    - **Sequence Generation:** For each stock, create sequences of a fixed length (e.g., 30 days of data) as input for the LSTM, with the next day's price movement (up/down) as the target label.
        

#### **Part 3: Temporal Feature Extraction with LSTM**

The first part of the model uses an LSTM to process the time-series data for each stock individually.

1. **LSTM Architecture:**
    
    - Define an LSTM model. The input shape will be `(sequence_length, num_features)`.
        
    - The paper states that _all hidden state outputs_ are used to construct the graph nodes. This means you will need to configure the LSTM layer to return all hidden states, not just the final one.
        
    - The output of this stage for each stock will be a feature matrix representing its temporal characteristics.
        
2. **Implementation:**
    
    - Create a class or function that defines the LSTM architecture.
        
    - Process each stock's sequential data through the LSTM to get its feature representation.
        

#### **Part 4: Dynamic Graph Construction**

This is a key step where the relationships between stocks are modeled.

1. **Correlation Calculation:**
    
    - For a given time window, take the LSTM-generated feature matrices for all stocks.
        
    - Calculate the **Pearson correlation coefficient** between the feature matrices of every pair of stocks. This will result in a correlation matrix.
        
2. **Adjacency Matrix Creation:**
    
    - The correlation matrix will serve as the weighted adjacency matrix for the graph. Each stock is a node, and the weight of the edge between two nodes is their correlation.
        
    - You may want to apply a threshold to the correlation values to create a sparser graph, though the paper uses the full correlation matrix.
        

#### **Part 5: Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for Prediction**

The GCN takes the graph structure and the node features to make the final prediction.

1. **GCN Architecture:**
    
    - Define a GCN model with one or more graph convolutional layers.
        
    - The input to the GCN will be:
        
        - The node features (the LSTM outputs for each stock).
            
        - The adjacency matrix (from the Pearson correlation).
            
    - The GCN layers will aggregate information from neighboring (i.e., correlated) stocks.
        
    - The final layer will be a fully connected layer with a softmax or sigmoid activation function to predict the trend (e.g., 'up' or 'down') for each stock.
        
2. **Implementation:**
    
    - Use a library like DGL or PyG to build the GCN layers.
        
    - The model will take the graph and node features and output a prediction for each node.
        

#### **Part 6: Model Training & Evaluation**

This section covers the process of training the combined model and evaluating its performance.

1. **Training Loop:**
    
    - For each batch of data (representing a time window):
        
        1. Pass the sequences through the LSTM to get node features.
            
        2. Construct the graph by calculating the correlation matrix.
            
        3. Feed the node features and adjacency matrix into the GCN.
            
        4. Calculate the loss (e.g., `CrossEntropyLoss` for classification).
            
        5. Perform backpropagation and update the model weights.
            
2. **Evaluation:**
    
    - Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
        
    - Evaluate the model on the test set using standard classification metrics:
        
        - Accuracy
            
        - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
            
        - Confusion Matrix
            

#### **Part 7: Backtesting & Trading Simulation**

The paper highlights the model's practical application in trading.

1. **Trading Strategy:**
    
    - Define a simple trading strategy based on the model's predictions:
        
        - If the model predicts 'up', issue a 'buy' signal.
            
        - If the model predicts 'down', issue a 'sell' signal.
            
2. **Simulation:**
    
    - Run a simulation on the test data.
        
    - Track a hypothetical portfolio's value over time.
        
    - Calculate financial metrics like:
        
        - Total Return
            
        - Sharpe Ratio
            
        - Maximum Drawdown
            
3. **Benchmark Comparison:**
    
    - Compare the model's performance against baseline strategies (e.g., a simple buy-and-hold strategy, or a standalone LSTM model) as done in the paper.
