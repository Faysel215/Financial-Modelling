# Outline for Kernel Density Estimation Script
1. Introduction & Purpose
Goal: To provide a robust algorithm for estimating the probability density function (PDF) of any given one-dimensional vector.
Core Method: Utilizes Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a non-parametric technique to produce a smooth density curve.
Key Feature: Incorporates an automated and optimized bandwidth selection process using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation to ensure the model adapts well to the input data.
2. Dependencies
numpy: For efficient numerical operations, especially array manipulation and vectorization.
matplotlib.pyplot: For visualizing the results by plotting the estimated density curve and the original data histogram.
scipy.stats.norm: To use the Gaussian (normal) distribution as the kernel function.
scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar: To perform the numerical optimization required to find the best bandwidth.
time: To measure the execution time of the bandwidth selection process.
3. Core Functions
_optimize_bandwidth_cv_vectorized(data)
Purpose: The helper function that contains the core logic for finding the optimal bandwidth h.
Input: data (A NumPy array).
Method:
Implements a vectorized version of Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV).
Defines an inner cross_validation_loss function that calculates the negative log-likelihood for a given bandwidth.
Vectorization avoids slow Python loops by computing an n x n matrix of pairwise kernel evaluations at once, dramatically improving performance.
Uses scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar to find the bandwidth value that minimizes the loss function (i.e., maximizes the log-likelihood).
Output: The single floating-point value representing the optimal bandwidth.
kernel_density_estimation(vector, grid_points, bandwidth_method)
Purpose: The main, user-facing function that orchestrates the entire density estimation process.
Inputs:
vector: The raw input data (list or NumPy array).
grid_points: The resolution for the output density curve.
bandwidth_method: A string ('cv' or 'scott') to select the bandwidth selection strategy.
Output: A tuple containing the x_grid and the density_estimate for plotting.
4. Algorithm Steps (within kernel_density_estimation)
Step 1: Data Preparation
Convert the input vector to a NumPy array.
Perform a sanity check to ensure the vector is not empty.
Step 2: Bandwidth Selection
Measure the start time for performance tracking.
If bandwidth_method == 'cv':
Call _optimize_bandwidth_cv_vectorized() to get the optimal bandwidth.
If bandwidth_method == 'scott':
Calculate the bandwidth using Scott's rule of thumb as a simpler, faster alternative.
Print the chosen bandwidth and the time taken.
Include a safety check to prevent a zero or negative bandwidth.
Step 3: Grid Setup
Define the range for the x-axis of the final plot.
Create an evenly spaced array of grid_points over this range.
Step 4: Final Density Calculation
Perform the Kernel Density Estimation using the selected bandwidth.
This step is also vectorized: it calculates the contribution of all data points to all grid points in a single, efficient operation.
Normalize the final estimate by the number of data points (n).
5. Execution Block (if __name__ == '__main__':)
Purpose: To demonstrate how to use the kernel_density_estimation function and to provide a visual test of the algorithm.
Process:
Generate Sample Data: Create a sample vector, specifically a bimodal distribution, which is a good test case for density estimators.
Run Estimation:
Call kernel_density_estimation() with bandwidth_method='cv' to get the optimized result.
Call it again with bandwidth_method='scott' to get the rule-of-thumb result for comparison.
Visualize Results:
Use matplotlib to create a plot.
Display the histogram of the original data as a reference.
Overlay the two KDE curves (optimized and Scott's rule) to visually compare their fits.
Add titles, labels, and a legend for clarity.
